# FSLIB
WIP, Switch and 3DS ~~(Maybe soon?)~~ FS function wrapper written in modern C++ (with some needed C) for JKSV and ~~possible~~ already happening JKSM rewrite. Currently functions almost 100% to the best of my knowledge.

# Notes
* The first priority is getting JKSV fully functional using this library. JKSV's functionality will take priority over adding functions for absolutely everything. A sample/testing program is included if you want a rough idea of functions and use.

* Both are as similar as they can be. Chances are if you can use FsLib on one system, you can use it on the other.

* The 3DS version uses UTF16 paths ~~and takes a back seat to Switch.~~
* 3DS version can completely replace ctrulib's archive_dev. Switch version will be able to do the same soon for LibNX and fs_dev.
# Why?
I recently took a look at both LibNX's fs_dev and ctrulib's archive_dev.
